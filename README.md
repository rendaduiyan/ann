# ann
ANN is short for artifcial neural network; it's widely used for pattern recognition (including image recogintion, motion dection, etc). This is just a start for pratical application of ANN. Beside the paralelle computation, ANN can be simplified into maxtrix compuation. This project is to split the computation into small computing units - neuron. This will have better performance for ANN with thousands of neurons in it.
# Status
This project is still in progress. The ANN in one thread is implemented; unit test is done and functional test with logical AND is done.
# To-Do
## thread-pool support for large networks
## performance benchmark
## update Readme
## applied to MNIST (Handwriting digit data set)
